# CoOpeRace: Cooperative Data Race Freedom Verification

CoOpeRace is a cooperative verification tool. 
It is a metaverfier that currently includes the following tools:
* Goblint: https://zenodo.org/records/10202867
* Dartagnan: https://zenodo.org/records/10161362

This is a preliminary version that only tries to run these tools sequentially.
The goal of the CoOpeRace project is to identify the ultimate state-of-the-art in race freedom verification,
attempt better ways of communicating intermediate results between tools, and 
provide a user interface for comparing output of different tools.
