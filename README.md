# CoOpeRace: Cooperative Data Race Freedom Verification

CoOpeRace is a cooperative verification tool. 
It is a metaverfier that currently includes the following tools:
* Goblint: https://zenodo.org/records/14054652
* Dartagnan: https://zenodo.org/records/14079770
* Deagle: https://zenodo.org/records/14189745
* uAutomizer: https://zenodo.org/records/10202867
* uGemCutter: https://zenodo.org/records/10202867

The goal of the CoOpeRace project is to identify the ultimate state-of-the-art in race freedom verification,
attempt better ways of communicating intermediate results between tools, and 
provide a user interface for comparing output of different tools.

To test the sv-comp package, run `./cooperace --prop tests/no-data-race.prp tests/no-data-race/00-sanity_09-include.i`.

## SV-COMP Smoketests in Docker

1. Run the automated smoketest inside the SV-COMP competition image:
   ```bash
   make svcomp
   ```
   The smoketest output is streamed to your terminal, and the build returns non-zero if the check fails.

2. After `make svcomp`, the Docker image `cooperace-smoketest` is available. Launch an interactive shell with:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 cooperace-smoketest /bin/bash
   ```
   The unpacked archive lives in `/opt/cooperace`; from there you can re-run `./smoketest.sh` or execute `./cooperace` manually. The container uses the SV-COMP competition base image, so you interact with the same environment as the automated smoketest.

If you want to force a completely fresh run (no cached layers), clear BuildKit cache data before re-running:
`docker builder prune --all --force`.

## Uploading the SV-COMP archive to Zenodo

Use the helper script in `scripts/sv-comp/upload-zenodo.py` to attach the freshly
packaged archive to a private Zenodo record. It requires the Python `requests`
package (`pip install requests`).

1. Ensure the archive exists (`make svcomp` produces `dist/cooperace.zip`).
2. Export your Zenodo API token:
   ```bash
   export ZENODO_TOKEN="<your-token>"
   ```
   The token needs the `deposit:write` scope. The record should either be a
   draft or have a "latest draft" available (Zenodo's "New version" action).
3. Upload the archive (replace `<draft-or-record-id>` with your Zenodo record
   identifier):
   ```bash
   python scripts/sv-comp/upload-zenodo.py --record-id <draft-or-record-id>
   ```
   Pass `--sandbox` if you want to test against `https://sandbox.zenodo.org` or
   override the archive path with `--file`. The helper streams the 200â€¯MB
   archive in chunks and prints upload progress so you can keep an eye on
   Zenodo's slow ingestion.
